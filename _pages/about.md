Robotics and AI are regarded as transformative tools for scientific discovery. The primary goal of the summer school is to engage students in and learn about laboratory automation for the discovery of energy materials. Through lectures, coding tutorials, robotic synthesis experiments, and a team competition, participants will be involved in close loop experiment design, machine learning, data handling and visualization, as well as work in the lab to make thin film semiconductors by using a robotic platform. We aim to foster the development of our future workforce in these fields, in anticipation of science and research integrating more and more artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML).  

The summer school is open to students with interdisciplinary backgrounds in materials science, chemistry, computer science, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, physics or related fields. No prior coding experience is needed. The event is scheduled for August 13-15, 2025 and as a parallel event with the Molecular Foundryâ€™s Annual User Meeting. 
The deadline to register is Monday, June 23, 2025. Please complete the registration form below to register for the upcoming Future Labs Summer School on Robotic Synthesis Coupled with Machine Learning for Energy Materials.
