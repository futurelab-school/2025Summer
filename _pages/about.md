## Scope:
- Robot Assisted Synthesis of Thin Film Semiconductors: Participants will actively engage in hands-on lab experiments to fabricate and characterize thin film halide perovskite semiconductors by making use of the Foundryâ€™s AutoBot robotic platform.  
- AI/ML Applications Exploration: Participants will learn how AI/ML is currently being utilized in the field of energy materials by actively applying it to your data collected in the lab. Participants will explore techniques that could revolutionize research practices.
- Gaps Identification: We will pinpoint deficiencies in knowledge and training that hinder the utilization of AI/ML in materials sciences. Participants will explore AI/ML tools to complement research practices. 
- Emerging Energy Materials Focus: We will teach you on the emergent thin film semiconductors halide perovskites for energy applications. These materials have their own challenges that we aim to tackle with AI/ML technologies.
